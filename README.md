Implementation of confabulation theory at the symbolic level and experiments
========

Implementation of different sentence completion architectures using
<a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Confabulation_theory_%28computational_intelligence%29">confabulation</a>
, module hierarchies and multiconfabulation using a symbol-level model of modules and knowledge links. 

This implementation is initially the product of a master thesis by Bernard
Paulus and CÃ©dric Snauwaert
